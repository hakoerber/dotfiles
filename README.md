# dotfiles

My configuration files.

# Installation

Because it manages multiple users on the system, the directory is supposed to be
at `/var/lib/dotfiles`.

To setup the dotfiles:

1. `git clone git://github.com:whatevsz/dotfiles ~/dotfiles`
2. `cd ~/dotfiles && ./bootstrap.sh`

# Required third party software

- `vim` uses the plugin manager "vundle", available [here](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle)
