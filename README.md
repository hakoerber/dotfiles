My configuration files.

# Installation


This project uses [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot), which makes setup really easy:

1. `git clone git://github.com:whatevsz/dotfiles ~/dotfiles`
2. `./install`

# Required third party software

- `vim` uses the plugin manager "vundle", available [here](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle)
